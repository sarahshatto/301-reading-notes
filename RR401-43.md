### **Notes:**

- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started)
	- The value of a framework: 
		- code is bundled using a bundler like web pack and transformed using a compiler like Babel
		- production optimizations like code splitting 
		- statically pre-rendering some pages for performance and SEO.
		- writing some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store. 
	- Creating a node.js app: 
		- terminal, 'cd' into your directory, run the command: 
```
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/tree/master/learn-starter"
```

- This creates a new directory called next js-blog . cd into it. 
```
cd nextjs-blog
```

- run the command: 
```
npm run dev
```

- This starts your Next.js app’s "development server" (more on this later) on port 3000 (view on http://localhost:3000) 
		- Ctrl + c to stop the server.
	- Pages in Next.js:
		- a page is a React Component exported from a file in the pages directory
		- Pages are associated with a route based on their file name.
	- Creating a new page: 
		- create the posts directory under pages . 
		- create a file called first-post.js inside the posts directory with the following content: 
```
export default function FirstPost() {
  return <h1>First Post</h1>
}
```
- the component can have any name, but you must export it as a default export. 
	- In a way, this is similar to building websites using HTML or PHP files. Instead of writing HTML you write JSX and use React Components.
		- Ex: if you wanted to create a new route /authors/me , the file name would be pages/authors/me.js
- Adding a link: 
	- linking between pages on websites, you use the ``<a>`` HTML tag. 
	-  use the Link Component from next/link to wrap the ``<a>`` tag. 
	- ``<Link>`` allows you to do client side navigation to a different page within your app. 
```
import Link from 'next/link'


----index.js
<h1 className="title">
  Read{' '}
  <Link href="/posts/first-post">
    <a>this page!</a>
  </Link>
</h1>
---

`{' '}` adds an empty space, which is used to divide text over multiple lines.

----pages/posts/first-post.js
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Back to home</a>
        </Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  )
}

```

-  ``Link`` component is similar to using ``<a>`` tags, but instead of ``<a href="…">``, you use <Link href="…"> and put an ``<a>`` tag inside.

- fun facts: The Link component enables client-side navigation between two pages in the same Next.js app. Client-side navigation means that the page transition happens using JavaScript, which is faster than the default navigation done by the browser. if we had used the ``<a href="...">`` , the effect would be cleared on link clicks because the browser does a full refresh.

- Gatsby Tutorial
	- CLI commands: gatsby --help
	- Creating a gatsby starter site: 
```
gatsby new hello-world https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```
- what this does: 
		- new is a gatsby command to create a new Gatsby project.
		- hello-world could be banana. 
		-  the GitHub URL specified points to a code repository that holds the starter code you want to use.
	- use the following command structure to create a new site based on any existing Gatsby starter:
```
gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME] [URL_OF_STARTER_GITHUB_REPO]
```
