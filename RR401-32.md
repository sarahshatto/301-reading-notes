### **Notes:**

React Hooks are a new API of the React library that allows us to have state, and other React characteristics, in the components created with a function. This was not possible before and forced us to create a component with the class to access all the possibilities of the library.

custom hooks - all you need to know

- Hooks are just functions- Anything that is a function can become a hook. 
	- Review: useEffect: 
		- can be used with or without "cleanup"
	- before hooks- we would use componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate
	- useEffect tells React that our component needs to do something after the component renders. It runs after the first render and after every update. 
			- you can useEffect with or without "cleanup", which seems like comparatively using componentDidMount and componentUnmount
	- If you do need cleanup to run, you can return a function from useEffect. This is optional and it allows you to run some code after your effect and before any new effect runs. A situation where you subscribe to something may need an unsubscribe as part of the effects cleanup process. React will perform this cleanup on unmount.


        ``` 
        useEffect(() => {
              console.log("Subscribe to Something);
              return function cleanup() {
                console.log("Unsubscribe to Something);
              };
            });

	- React cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects of the next render, and this should be noted. 
	- why hooks run on each update
	- We can also optimize performance by skipping effects with an optional argument. For instance, maybe we don't want to run the subscribe/unsubscribe effect unless some id has changed: 
      ```
      useEffect(() => {
            console.log("Subscribe to Something);
            return () => {
              console.log("Unsubscribe to Something);
            };
          }, [props.something.id]); // only if something.id changes
      ```
	- creating a custom hook"
	  
		- Custom Hooks are JavaScript functions whose names are prefixed with the word use. A custom Hook is a normal function but we hold them to a different standard. By adding the word use to the beginning, it lets us know that this function follows the rules of Hooks.
		- a Hook can call a Hook
      ```
      import React, { Component, useState, useEffect } from 'react';

          const useDocumentTitle = title => {
            useEffect(() => {
              document.title = title;
            }, [title])
          }

          function Counter() {
            const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
            const incrementCount = () => setCount(count + 1);
            useDocumentTitle(`You clicked ${count} times`);

            // useEffect(() => {
            //   document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`
            // });

            return (
              <div>
                <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
                <button onClick={incrementCount}>Click me</button>
              </div>
            )
          }

          export default Counter;
      ```


### Async hooks:


Search query example:

      
      // Round 1: Setting initial state, when a user searches for a book, it returns a list. 

      function App() {
        const [search, setSearch] = React.useState("");
        const [query, setQuery] = React.useState("");

        return (
          <div className="App">
            <h1> Search for Books on any Topic </h1>
            <form
              onSubmit={e => {
                e.preventDefault();
                setQuery(search);
              }}
            >
              <label>Search : </label>
              <input type="text" onChange={e => setSearch(e.target.value)} />
              <input type="submit" value="search" />
            </form>

            <h1>List Result on {query}</h1>
          </div>
        );
     


```
// Round 2: custom async hook, a flag for loading- We are fetching our books from google api and then updating our 'setResult' state with book title. React.useEffect method will only run when our 'searchBook' is changed

function useAsyncHook(searchBook) {
  const [result, setResult] = React.useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState("false");

  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchBookList() {
      try {
        setLoading("true");
        const response = await fetch(
          `https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=${searchBook}`
        );

        const json = await response.json();
        // console.log(json);
        setResult(
          json.items.map(item => {
            console.log(item.volumeInfo.title);
            return item.volumeInfo.title;
          })
        );
      } catch (error) {
        setLoading("null");
      }
    }

    if (searchBook !== "") {
      fetchBookList();
    }
  }, [searchBook]);

  return [result, loading];
}

```


- We cannot use 'async' keyword with 'useEffect' callback method. It will result in race conditions..


```
// Round 3: Updated App Component


function App() {
  const [search, setSearch] = React.useState(""); // intializing some state: 
  const [query, setQuery] = React.useState("");
  const [result, loading] = useAsyncHook(query);


  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Search for Books on any Topic</h1>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          setQuery(search);
        }}
      >
        <label>Search : </label>
        <input type="text" onChange={e => setSearch(e.target.value)} />
        <input type="submit" value="search" />
      </form>

      {loading === "false" ? (
        <h1>Search for Books</h1>
      ) : loading === "null" ? (
        <h1>No Book Found</h1>
      ) : (
        result.map(item => {
          return <p>Book Title : {item}</p>;
        })
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useReducer Hook

- Hooks review:
	- **useState**
      ```
      const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
      ```

  - Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.
  - During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState).
  - **setState**
  - The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.
      ```
      setState(newState);

      ///////////////////////////////////

      function Counter({initialCount}) {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
        return (
          <>
            Count: {count}
            <button onClick={() => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset</button>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-</button>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+</button>
          </>
        );
      }
      ```


- During subsequent re-renders, the first value returned by useState will always be the most recent state after applying updates.

	- **useReducer**
	  
		- useful for managing state objects that contain multiple sub-values.
		- initialState argument is the state used during the initial render. 
	- **useEffect**
	  
		- Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.
		- Mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects are not allowed inside the main body of a function component (referred to as React’s render phase). Doing so will lead to confusing bugs and inconsistencies in the UI.
		- Instead, use useEffect. The function passed to useEffect will run after the render is committed to the screen. Think of effects as an escape hatch from React’s purely functional world into the imperative world.
		- By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire them only when certain values have changed
		- To conditionally fire off an effect, pass a second argument to useEffect that is the array of values that the effect depends on. Our updated example now looks like this:
```
useEffect(
  () => {
    const subscription = props.source.subscribe();
    return () => {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
  },
  [props.source],
);
```

- Now the subscription will only be recreated when props.source changes.
useContext

```
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

- Accepts a context object (the value returned from React.createContext) and returns the current context value for that context. The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest <MyContext.Provider> above the calling component in the tree.


- [Custom Hooks - React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)
- Building your own hooks: 
	- Allows you to extract component logic into reusable functions
	- When we want to share logic between two JavaScript functions, we extract it to a third function. Both components and Hooks are functions, so this works for them too!
	- A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks.
	- nothing new inside of it — the logic is copied from the components above. Just like in a component, make sure to only call other Hooks unconditionally at the top level of your custom Hook.
	- You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, etc...
