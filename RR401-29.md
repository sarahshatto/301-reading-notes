### **Notes:**

### **Questions to answer:**

1. Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?
2. When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
3. Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
4. What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children

### **Vocabulary Terms:**

- props.children:
- composition:


## Router component: 
- [browser router tutorial](https://blog.pshrmn.com/entry/simple-react-router-v4-tutorial/)
	-  Choose your Router
	- Create your routes
	- navigate between routes using links
		- Choosing your Router: Installation: 
			- React Router is broken into 3 packages: 
      ```
      react-router-dom	
      react-router
      react-router-native
      ```
		- building a website: 
      ```
      npm install --save react-router-dom
      ```
		- Every time that you're starting a new project, you need to decide which type of router to use: 
			- browser based projects: <BrowserRouter> & <HashRouter>
				- <BrowserRouter> is used when you have a server that will handle dynamic requests (knows how to respond to any possible URI)
				- <HashRouter> should be used for static websites
			- Each router creates a history object, which it uses to keep track of the current location and re-render the website whenever that changes. 
				- Other components in React depend on that history object, and they need to be rendered as descendants of a router component. ( A react router component that does not have a router as one of it’s ancestors won’t work) 
				- History object: More info: 
			- Router components only expect to receive a single child element. 
				- Create an <App> component that renders the rest of your application. 
				- Separating the application from the router is good for server rendering because you can re-use the <App> on the server.
      ```
      import {BrowserRouter} from ‘react-router-dom’

      ReactDOM.render((
      <BroswerRouter>
          <App />
      </BrowserRouter>
      ), document.getElementById(‘root’));
      ```

 -  < App > <br>
  - Application is defined within < App >
  - < Header > component in this example will hold links to nav between site. 
- < Main > component is where the rest of the content will live. 
      

      function App() {
      return ( 
          <div>
              <Header /> 
              <Main />
          </div>
      );
      }
 
	- < Main > 
		- Where we will render our routes. 
		- < Route > component: the main building block of React Router. 
			- Use this anywhere that you want to only render content based on the location’s pathname.
			- < Route > expects a < path > prop, which is a string that describes a pathname that the route matches.
				- Ex: < Route path=‘/roster’/ > should match a pathname that begins with /roster.
			- When the current location’s pathname is matched by the path, the route will render a React element. 
    ```
    <Route path=‘/roster’/>
        // when the pathname is ‘/’, the path does not match
        // when the pathname is ‘/roster’ or ‘/roster/2’, the path matches
        // If you only want to match ‘/roster’, then you need to use the “exact” prop. 
            // <Route exact path= ‘/roster’/>

    Router is only looking for the following: 

    Example URL: http://www.example.com/my-projects/one?extra=false
                                      |- /my-projects/one -|


- Uses regex to match
- When the path matches, a math object with the following properties will be created: 
      
      url: the matched part of the current locations pathname
      path: the route’s path
      isExact: path === pathname
      Params: an object containing values from the pathname that were captured by the path-to-regexp


	- < Route > Can be created anywhere inside of the router, but often makes sense to render them in the same place.
	- You can use the <Switch> Component to group multiple <Route> Components. The <Switch> Will iterate over it’s children elements and only render the first one that matches the current pathname.
			- Example Website:
				- the paths that we want to match are: 
					- / — The home page
					- /roster — the team’s roster
					- /roster:number — specific to a plater on the roster, utilizing their number
					- /schedule — the team’s schedule of games
```
<Switch>
    <Route exact path= ‘/‘ component={Home}/>
        /* Note: both /roster and /roster:number begin with the same ‘/roster’ */
    <Route path= ‘/roster‘ component={Roster}/>
    <Route path= ‘/schedule‘ component={Schedule}/>
</Switch>
```

- Routes have three props that can be used to define what should be rendered when the route’s path matches. Only one should be provided to a <Route> Element. 
- Component:
	- a react component. When a route with a component prop matches, the route will return a new element.
- Render: 
	- A function that returns a react element. Is useful for inline rendering and passing extra props to the element.
- Children:
	- A function that returns a React element. This will always be rendered, regardless of whether the route’s path matches the current location. 
```
// component
    <Route exact path= ‘/page‘ component={Page}/>
      const extraProps = { color: ‘red’ }
________________________________________________________

// render
    <Route path= ‘/page‘ render={( props ) => (
        Page {...props} data= {extraProps}/>
)}/>

________________________________________________________

// children
    
    <Route path= ‘/page‘ children={( props ) => (
        props.match
        ? <Page {...props}/>
        : <EmptyPage {...props}/>
)}/>
```
- the component rendered by the < Route > Will be passed a number of props:
	- the match object
	- the current location object
	- the history object
```
import { Switch, Route } from ‘react-router-dom’
function Main() {
    return {
    <main>
        <Switch>
            <Route exact path=‘/‘ component={Home}/>
            <Route exact path=‘/roster‘ component={Roster}/>
            <Route exact path=‘/schedule‘ component={Schedule}/>
        </Switch>
    </main>
    );
}
```
- Nested routes (Ex. /roster/:number) 
	- Handled within the Roster component:
		- Ex: /roster and /roster/:number:
			- /roster should only be matched when the pathname is exactly /roster, so we also give the route element the exact prop.
			- /roster/:number catches the path param to capture the number that comes after
```
function Roster() {
    return(
        <Switch>
            <Route exact path=‘/roster’ component={FullRoster}/>
            <Route path=‘/roster/:number’ component={Player}/>
        </Switch>
    );
}
```
- Note that there is potential to add in content that would be consistent across the Roster pages, such as a header. 
- Path Params:
- Adding path params to our route’s path string (ex: /roster/:number) allows us to capture the player’s number and store it in match.params.number
	- Ex: /roster/6 will generate a params object:
		- { number: ‘6’ } // captured in a string.
- This is important for when the <Player> component wants to go into the props.match.params object to determine which player’s data will be rendered:
```
// an API that returns a player’s object: 

import PlayerAPI from ‘./PlayerAPI’

function Player(props) {
    const player = PlayerAPI.get(
        parseInt(props.match.params.number, 10)
    )
    if(!player){
        return <div> Sorry, that player was not found </div> 
    }
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>{player.name} (#{player.number})</h1>
            <h2>{player.position}</h2>
        </div>

    ); 
}
```

```
function FullRoster() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {
          PlayerAPI.all().map(p => (
            <li key={p.number}>
              <Link to={`/roster/${p.number}`}>{p.name}</Link>
            </li>
          ))
        }
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

function Schedule() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>6/5 @ Evergreens</li>
        <li>6/8 vs Kickers</li>
        <li>6/14 @ United</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Tornadoes Website!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Links:
  - React gives us the <Link> component, so that the page doesn’t have to reload every time a person clicks on a link. When clicking the link, the URL will be updated, and the rendered content will change without reloading the page.

```
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to='/'>Home</Link></li>
          <li><Link to='/roster'>Roster</Link></li>
          <li><Link to='/schedule'>Schedule</Link></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
}
```

- < Link > uses the prop to describe the location that they should navigate to.
