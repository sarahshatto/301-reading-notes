### **Notes:**

### **Questions to answer:**
1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
2. What can be passed along in a prop variable?
3. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### **Vocabulary Terms:**
- **component props**
- **component state**
- **application state**

## Component Lifecycle: 
  - [link to image](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/)
- Begins in the constructor
- **mounting :**
	- Class based components: 
      - first method runs is **the constructor method**
      - initial component state
		- component then runs ```getDerivedStateFromProps```
		- render method that returns your JSX
		- React "mounts" to the DOM
		- componentDidMount method runs
		- here is where you would do async calls to databases/directly manipulate the DOM if needed.
  - moves into updating (until no longer needed)
	- updating is triggered every time state or props change
	- getDerivedStateFromProps is called
	- shouldComponentUpdate runs
		- compares old props/state with the new set of props/state: returns true or false
		- if false, update cycle ends. If true, React re-renders and getSnapshotBeforeUpdate runs afterwards.
		- React runs componentDidUpdate
		- componentDidMount- use it to make async calls to the manipulate the DOM
- **Unmounting**
	- final stage of the lifecycle- componentWillUnmount runs before it gets removed
		- resolve any open connections like WebSockets or intervals.
	- forceUpdate is a method that directly causes a re-render.  AVOID 
	- getDerivedStateFromError on the other hand is a lifecycle method that isn’t directly part of the component lifecycle. In the event of an error in a component, getDerivedStateFromError runs and you can update state to reflect that an error occurred. Use this method copiously.can only be in one stage at a time
  
```
class App extend React.component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    console.log('Hello from constructor')
    }
}

  static getDerivedStateFromProps(){
    console.log('Hello from before rendering')
  }

  componentDidMount(){
    console.log('Hello from after mounting')
  }

  render(){
  console.log('Hello from Render')

  return(
    <div> Hello! </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

In the console: 
1. Hello from constructor
2. Hello from from before rendering
3. Hello from Render
4. Hello from after mounting

	- Higher order components: 
		- is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
		- allow us to do is abstract shared logic between components into a single overarching component
		- Great use is Auth that can reused to keep your code dry. Link to a good example. 
		- Allow us to reuse code and remove bloat.
	- React State and setState
		- when there’s a state change, React will trigger a re-render on that component
		- The only way you should change state is via the setState method. This method takes an object and merges it into the current state. 
		- setState is asynchronous.
