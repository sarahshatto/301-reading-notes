### **Notes:**

- [making sense of hooks](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889)
- Components and top down data flow help us organize a large UI into small, independent, reusable pieces.
  - Sometimes we cannot completely “separate concerns” and break the component down any further because the logic refers to state and can’t be extracted into a function or another component.
    - You may see this: 
    - animations 
    - form handling
    - connecting to external data resources
- This can create huge components that are hard to refactor, duplicated logic between components and lifecycle methods.
  - Complex patterns like render props and higher-order components.
  - Hooks allow us to organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units. 
  - Greater visual organization and reusability
  - ”Hooks apply the React philosophy (explicit data flow and composition) inside of a component, rather than just between components.”
  - Hooks don’t introduce unnecessary nesting into your component tree.
  - Allow you to always use functions instead of having to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props. 
  - How we reuse logic in React: 
    - simple functions that calculate something.
    - components (which themselves can be functions or classes)
    - more powerful, but have to render some UI.
  - Higher order components: an advanced react technique that allows you to share component logic. 
  - functions are the easiest way to reuse logic, however, functions can have local react state inside them. 
  - Hooks solve this- they let you use React features, like state, from a function by doing a single function call. React has a few built in hooks exposing the building blocks of react- state, lifecycles, and context.
    - since hooks are regular javascript functions, you can combine built in hooks with your own custom hooks. (technically custom hooks aren't a react feature) 
  - example: 

// Our custom Hook

      function MyResponsiveComponent() {
        const width = useWindowWidth();         
        return (
          <p>Window width is {width}</p>
        );
      }

      // How you would implement this custom hook

      function useWindowWidth() {
        const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
        useEffect(() => {
          const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
          window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
          return () => {
            window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
          };
        });
        return width;
      }

- useState and useEffect serve as the basic building blocks. We can use them from our components directly, or we can combine them into custom hooks like usewindowwidth. (above)
- Hooks are fully encapsulated - each time you call a hook, it gets isolated local state within the currently executing component.
- "They are not a way to share state- they are a way to share stateful logic." 
- Each Hook may contain some local state and side effects. You can pass data between multiple Hooks just like you normally do between functions. They can take arguments and return values because they are JavaScript functions.
- in order for custom Hooks to work, React needs to provide functions with a way to declare state and side effects.
- Building your own hooks - React docs
- Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions
- A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks.
   We can decide what it takes as arguments, and what, if anything, it should return. In other words, it’s just like a normal function. Its name should always start with use so that you can tell at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it.
- the state hook


      import React, { useState } from 'react';

      function Example() {
        // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        return (
          <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
              Click me
            </button>
          </div>
        );
      }


      As a reminder, function components in React look like this:

      ////////////////////////////////////

      const Example = (props) => {
        // You can use Hooks here!
        return <div />;
      }

      ////////////////////////////////////

      or this:

      ////////////////////////////////////

      function Example(props) {
        // You can use Hooks here!
        return <div />;
      }

      ////////////////////////////////////

	- Hooks don’t work inside classes. But you can use them instead of writing classes.
	- What is a Hook? A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components
	- When would I use a Hook? If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.

      import React, { useState } from 'react';

      function Example() {
        // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	- What does calling useState do? It declares a “state variable”. Our variable is called count but we could call it anything else, like banana. This is a way to “preserve” some values between the function calls — useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables “disappear” when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.
- The only argument to the useState() Hook is the initial state.
-  the state doesn’t have to be an object.
-  useState returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. This is why we write const [count, setCount] = useState().

      import React, { useState } from 'react';

      function Example() {
        // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	- In a function component, we have no this, so we can’t assign or read this.state. Instead, we call the useState Hook directly inside our component

          1:  import React, { useState } from 'react';
          2:
          3:  function Example() {
          4:    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
          5:
          6:    return (
          7:      <div>
          8:        <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
          9:        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          10:         Click me
          11:        </button>
          12:      </div>
          13:    );
          14:  }

 - Line 1: We import the useState Hook from React. It lets us keep local state in a function component.
 - Line 4: Inside the Example component, we declare a new state variable by calling the useState Hook. It returns a pair of values, to which we give names. We’re calling our variable count because it holds the number of button clicks. We initialize it to zero by passing 0 as the only useStateargument. The second returned item is itself a function. It lets us update the count so we’ll name it setCount.
		- Line 9: When the user clicks, we call setCount with a new value. React will then re-render the Example component, passing the new count value to it.

      const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');


- This JavaScript syntax is called “array destructuring”. It means that we’re making two new variables fruit and setFruit, where fruit is set to the first value returned by useState, and setFruit is the second. It is equivalent to this code:

      var fruitStateVariable = useState('banana'); // Returns a pair
      var fruit = fruitStateVariable[0]; // First item in a pair
      var setFruit = fruitStateVariable[1]; // Second item in a pair


- hooks api
	-  “side effects” (or “effects” for short) because they can affect other components and can’t be done during rendering.
		- data fetching, 
		- subscriptions, 
		- or manually changing the DOM from React components
	- The Effect Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API. 

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

      function Example() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
        useEffect(() => {
          // Update the document title using the browser API
          document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
        });

        return (
          <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
              Click me
            </button>
          </div>
        );
      }

	- When you call useEffect, you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state. By default, React runs the effects after every render — including the first render. 
- Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks. We’ll learn about them in a moment.)
	- Building your own hooks:
		- Custom Hooks:  reuse some stateful logic between components.
		- The state of each component is completely independent. Hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic, not state itself. In fact, each callto a Hook has a completely isolated state — so you can even use the same custom Hook twice in one component.

### **Questions to answer:**

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
	- Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
	- Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
	- Inside a <Route />
