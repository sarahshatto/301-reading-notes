### **Notes:**

- getting started with react native
	- With React, you can make components using either classes or functions. Originally, class components were the only components that could have state. But since the introduction of React's Hooks API, you can add state and more to function components.
	- Core components and native components
	- you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code.
	- view is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input.'

| REACT NATIVE UI COMPONENT | ANDROID VIEW | IOS VIEW    | WEB ANALOG  | DESCRIPTION |
| ----------- | --------------- | -----------  | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| < View >    | < ViewGroup > | < UIView > | A non-scrollling < div > | A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls
| < Text > | < TextView > | < UITextView > | < p > | Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events |
|< Image >|< ImageView >|< UIImageView >|< img >| Displays different types of images |
| < ScrollView >|< ScrollView >|< UIScrollView >|< div >|A generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views|
| < TextInput > | < EditText > | < UITextField > | < input type="text" >| Allows the user to enter text |

      import React from 'react';
      import { View, Text, Image, ScrollView, TextInput } from 'react-native';

      const App = () => {
        return (
          <ScrollView>
            <Text>Some text</Text>
            <View>
              <Text>Some more text</Text>
              <Image
                source={{
                  uri: 'https://reactnative.dev/docs/assets/p_cat2.png',
                }}
                style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
              />
            </View>
            <TextInput
              style={{
                height: 40,
                borderColor: 'gray',
                borderWidth: 1
              }}
              defaultValue="You can type in me"
            />
          </ScrollView>
        );
      }

      export default App;

**revisiting React basics: Components**
      import React from 'react';
      import { Text } from 'react-native';

      const Cat = () => {
        return (
          <Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>
        );
      }

      export default Cat;

- to create a component:
	- first use JavaScript’s import to import React and React Native’s Text Core Component:

          import React from 'react';
          import { Text } from 'react-native';

- component starts as a function:
              
      const Cat = () => {};

- Components are like blueprints: whatever a function component returns is rendered as a react element. 


      // <Text> element Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events

      const Cat = () => {
          return <Text> Hello, I am a cat! </Text>
      };

      export default Cat; 

- [Cheatsheet on JS imports and exports](https://medium.com/dailyjs/javascript-module-cheatsheet-7bd474f1d829)
  - think of curly braces as creating a portal into JS functionality in your JSX: 

        // Refresh on JSX: JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript. Because JSX is Javascript, you can use variables inside it. In our example below, we can declare a name for the cat, {name}, and embed it with curly braces inside <Text>

        import React from 'react';
        import { Text } from 'react-native';

        const Cat = () => {
          const name = "Maru";
          return (
            <Text>Hello, I am {name}!</Text>
          );
        }

        export default Cat;

-  Custom Components
- React lets you nest these components inside each other to create new components. 

      import React from 'react';
      import { Text, TextInput, View } from 'react-native';

      const Cat = () => {
          return(   
          <View>
            <Text>Hello, I am...</Text>
            <TextInput
              style={{
                height: 40,
                borderColor: 'gray',
                borderWidth: 1
              }}
              defaultValue="Name me!"
            />
          </View>
          );
      }

- Any component that renders other components is a parent component. 
	- Here, Cafe is the parent component and each Cat is a child component.
	- Each one of the Cat elements within the return is their own element, and each one can be customized through props. 


          import React from 'react';
          import { Text, TextInput, View } from 'react-native';

          const Cat = () => {
            return (
              <View>
                <Text>I am also a cat!</Text>
              </View>
            );
          }

          const Cafe = () => {
            return (
              <View>
                <Text>Welcome!</Text>
                <Cat name="Maru" />
                <Cat name="Jellylorum" />
                <Cat name="Spot" />
              </View>
            );
          }

          export default Cafe;

- Props, short for properties, allows you to customize react components. The example above has a property of "name" to differentiate the cats. 
- example, when using Image, you pass it a prop named source to define what image it shows. 

      <Image
              source={{uri: "https://reactnative.dev/docs/assets/p_cat1.png"}}
              style={{width: 200, height: 200}}
            />
            <Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>
          </View>



      /* 
      double curly braces {{ }} surrounding style‘s width and height. In JSX, JavaScript values are referenced with {}. This is handy if you are passing something other than a string as props, like an array or number: <Cat food={["fish", "kibble"]} age={2} />. However, JS objects are also denoted with curly braces: {width: 200, height: 200}. Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: {{width: 200, height: 200}}
      */


- Image has many different props, including style, which accepts a JS object of design and layout related property-value pairs.
	- State: useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory. 
	- to build something interactive, you’ll need state. you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a component’s personal data storage. 
	- Props vs State: As a general rule, use props to configure a component when it renders. Use state to keep track of any component data that you expect to change over time.

example takes place in a cat cafe where two hungry cats are waiting to be fed. Their hunger, which we expect to change over time (unlike their names), is stored as state. To feed the cats, press their buttons—which will update their state. Props include names. 
- You can use useState to track any kind of data: strings, numbers, Booleans, arrays, objects. For example, you can track the number of times a cat has been petted with const [timesPetted, setTimesPetted] = useState(0)!

      import React, { useState } from "react";
      import { Button, Text, View } from "react-native";       // the stuff you're using from react native

      const Cat = (props) => {                                 // creating the function component that takes in props 
        const [isHungry, setIsHungry] = useState(true);       // initializing the state w/ useState hook 

        return (
            <View> // view is like a div 
              <Text>       // text is like a p tag 
              I am {props.name}, and I am {isHungry ? : "full"}! // we use brackets to access props, and a terinary
              </Text>
              <Button
              onPress={ () => {
                setIsHungry(false);                   // when you push the button, it sets the state of isHungry to false.
              }}
              disabled={!isHungry} // now you can't see the button? 
              title={isHungry ? "Pour me some milk, please!" : "Thank you!"} // the state determines the title
            />
        </View>
        );
      } 

- REVIEW: using useState does two things: 
	- creates a state variable with an initial value  

          const [isHungry, setIsHungry] = useState(true);    // state variable is "isHungry", intitial value is "true" 
                                                            // function to set the state variable is "setIsHungry"

- it creates a function to set that state variable's value: 

      [<getter>, <setter>] = useState(<initialValue>)

	- Handling Text Input
	- <textInput> is a core component that allows user to enter text. 
		- contains an "onChangeText" prop that takes a function to be called every time the text has changed
		- contains an "onSubmitEditing" prop that takes a function to be called when text is submitted

              import React, { useState } from 'react';
              import { Text, TextInput, View } from 'react-native';

              const PizzaTranslator = () => {
                const [text, setText] = useState('');
                return (
                  <View style={{padding: 10}}>
                    <TextInput
                      style={{height: 40}}
                      placeholder="Type here to translate!"
                      onChangeText={text => setText(text)}
                      defaultValue={text}
                    />
                    <Text style={{padding: 10, fontSize: 42}}>
                      {text.split(' ').map((word) => word && '🍕').join(' ')}
                    </Text>
                  </View>
                );
              }

              export default PizzaTranslator;


	- this example had text in the state, because it changes over time. 
	- ScrollView
	- scrollview is a generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views.
	- ScrollViews can be configured to allow paging through views using swiping gestures by using the pagingEnabled props.
	- On iOS a ScrollView with a single item can be used to allow the user to zoom content. Set up the maximumZoomScale and minimumZoomScale props and your user will be able to use pinch and expand gestures to zoom in and out.
	- Lists
	- either FlatList or SectionList.
		- FlatList component displays a scrolling list of changing, but similarly structured data. 
		- works well for lists of data , where the number of entries may change over time.
		- only renders elements that are currently showing on the screen, not all of the elements at once. 
		- requires two props: data and renderItem. data is the source of information for the list,  renderItem takes one item from the source and returns a formatted component to render. 
		-  If you want to render a set of data broken into logical sections, maybe with section headers, similar to UITableViews on iOS, then a SectionList is the way to go:


            import React from 'react';
            import { SectionList, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

            const styles = StyleSheet.create({
              container: {
              flex: 1,
              paddingTop: 22
              },
              sectionHeader: {
                paddingTop: 2,
                paddingLeft: 10,
                paddingRight: 10,
                paddingBottom: 2,
                fontSize: 14,
                fontWeight: 'bold',
                backgroundColor: 'rgba(247,247,247,1.0)',
              },
              item: {
                padding: 10,
                fontSize: 18,
                height: 44,
              },
            })

            const SectionListBasics = () => {
                return (
                  <View style={styles.container}>
                    <SectionList
                      sections={[
                        {title: 'D', data: ['Devin', 'Dan', 'Dominic']},
                        {title: 'J', data: ['Jackson', 'James', 'Jillian', 'Jimmy', 'Joel', 'John', 'Julie']},
                      ]}
                      renderItem={({item}) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item}</Text>}
                      renderSectionHeader={({section}) => <Text style={styles.sectionHeader}>{section.title}</Text>}
                      keyExtractor={(item, index) => index}
                    />
                  </View>
                );
            }

            export default SectionListBasics;
